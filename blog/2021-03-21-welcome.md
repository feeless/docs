Welcome to the Feeless documentation and blog. I'm not much of a blogger but will try to keep this section up
to date with news and interesting discoveries.

## What is this?

[Feeless](https://feeless.dev/) is an implementation of [Nano](https://nano.org/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I am a huge fan of Nano, and decided to start this project as a way to learn how Nano works internally.

At the time of writing, Feeless can be used as a fully working [Rust crate](https://crates.io/feeless) with fairly covered [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/feeless/) (although still progressing).

Feeless also can be used via the command-line to manage a wallet, convert between keys, e.g. private to public to addresses. It can also do transforms between units, e.g. nano to micronano.

## The Plan

Basically the plan is to keep working on the project, making sure it is continuously polished and accurate. The eventual goal is to have a fully functional node that can be used as an alternative to the official C++ implementation.
