## What is Feeless?

**Feeless** is a **Nano** cryptocurrency node, wallet, tools, and Rust crate. This is not the official project for Nano,
only an implementation written in Rust.

üö∏ This is a work in progress. The API will probably change without notice until `v0.2`. üö∏

I decided to start this project as a personal adventure of understanding Nano. I give no promises about my future
motivation to complete this project ü§ê.
