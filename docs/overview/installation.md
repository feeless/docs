Currently the only way to install the binary is using a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> tool
called `cargo`. `cargo` is installed via `rustup`.

1. Install <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> (which installs `cargo`).
2. Download or check out the <a href="https://github.com/feeless/feeless/">source code</a>.
3. Go into the directory and run `cargo install`.
4. This will take a while to build, then will be installed in the <a
   href="http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/second-edition/ch14-04-installing-binaries.html">rust binary path</a>.

In the near future there will be a binary available from the Github releases page.
